# Project_FrontendMentorLandingPage
This is my first project done with SASS(css with superpowers). It helped me learn a lot about the cool features of scss and get comfortable with in writing scss. 
I learnt to use - Scss partials(with @foward & @use),functions , nesting, using media queries the easier way with mixins and a lot.
It took some time to write so many stylings; but the process was worth it and im Satisfied with how the site turned out.
